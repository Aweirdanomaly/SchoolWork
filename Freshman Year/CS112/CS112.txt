				CS112 Notes




import java.util.*;  ----------------imports input library <wack ass>

Scanner var = new Scanner(System.in); -------------- get keyboard input
var.next(); -----------actually gets input

"Static bois are local to the class" So scope of class 

Casting allows for system to mathematically treat a variable like the variable that is casted

A.K.A.

cents = 52

cents / 100  ----------int division
(double) / 100 ------------regular division




Static-------- class variables (variables declare in class, not in method) 

Stack --------all variable bois "local variables, parameters"

Heap ---------the actual objects

lol = "ayy, lmao" -------------gets its own special place in the heap called "Consant String Pool"



String slicing doesn't exist in Java, must use methods (plz look them up and put them here) (nol lah, I'll memorize them)


type[] ------------------------make array boi

Use  .equals() when comparing two objects.



constructors----------initialize objects

mutators--------------modify the objects data

accesors--------------retrieve object's data


when printing objects, Java will call the ".toSting()" method.

Java object is the root class from which everything stems.




			Sorts, Big-Os and Shit





Selection Sort: Scan through and find smallest from scanned



Insertion Sort: 
Start at i = 1
copy element to variable
if element smaller than sorted, shift sorted element to right
