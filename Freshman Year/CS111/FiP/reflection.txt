For the source bodies of text I used all the books except the last one from the Bible (King James version) and the transcripts for all the scenes in the Bee Movie (Dreamworks 2007) except the ending. Regarding the new texts that I used to compare against these sources, I used the entire script of the Shrek movie, an excerpt from the Qur'an, an excerpt from the Bible (the last book), and the ending scene from the movie (right at the punch line for the keychain joke). 

I'd say that my results were pretty spot on since the program managed to recognize that both of the excerpts (the Bible and Bee Movie one) were from their respective works. However, I'm a little dissapointed that the program classified the Shrek transcript as more similar to the Bee Movie script than the Bible. Of course, this just means that the program is more accurate than I expected, but I'm still bummed this result didn't come into fruition.

Also, the program said that the Qur'an excerpt was more closely related to the Bee Movie script than the Bible, but that's understandable since the excerpt that I got from the Qur'an was translated to a more modern type of English (one which does not use words like "thou", "hast", or "thine") and was a decently short excerpt. I'm quite ecertain that if I'd had made the excerpt longer, the program would have caught on to the frequency of words like "God" throughout the text. In addition to the previous sentence, the program could be improved via adding more classifications such as by making the program look for the frequency of specific words related to old English that simply aren't used today anymore (such as all those words that end with "-th")
