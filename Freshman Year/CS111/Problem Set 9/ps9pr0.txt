I feel like I would use it, but I’d be careful with it since it can see everything on my computer. I’d try and turn it off whenever I’d be looking at sensitive or personal data (Social Security Numbers, bank Statements, etc…), but knowing me, I’d probably forget to turn it off on at least one occasion. After realizing my mistake, I’d probably either become paranoid and delete it all from my computer, or I’d accept it and just keep it on at all times. I couldn’t quite tell you which of those scenarios would happen, but the former is more likely. However, I do feel like it could help me be slightly more productive in the sense that it would help me remember things. However, I feel like I’d probably only use it once or twice, just like the rest of my Google extensions. Even then, that’s still two times that it would help me to be more productive.
