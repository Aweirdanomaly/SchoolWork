In the "Case for Reparations" by TA-NEHISI COATES, the author claims that rascist opinions in the past have alienated blacks into their own separated neighboorhoods. In addition, these neighborhoods and their sorrounding infrastructures are not well maintained and serve to opress them. As a consequence of this alienation, blacks don't have the same opportunities to succeed as the rest of the population and are doomed to have their lineage and themselves stuck in the lower classes. In response, the acknowledgement of the problem needs to be made, and just compensation to these neighborhoods needs to be provided to bring them up to standard as the rest of the neighborhoods in the U.S.
