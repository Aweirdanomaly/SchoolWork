# SchoolWork
Just somewhere to put my homework, assignments, and notes from Boston University.
If you wanna see what my CS work mainly consists of, you can look around for any course that has the "CS" prefix.
PY is physics, GRS are graduate courses, and anything else is probably humanity prereqs. Good luck finding what you need!
